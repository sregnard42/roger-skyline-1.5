| Setup |
---------

::::::::::
:: Sudo ::
::::::::::

Log in as the non-root user
`su` to log in as root
`apt-get install sudo vim -y`
`vi /etc/sudoers`
Add to the file :
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
username	ALL(ALL:ALL) ALL
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can now exit to go back to your non-root user and use sudo when you need root privileges

:::::::::::::::
:: Static IP ::
:::::::::::::::

`sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces`
Remove or comment the already existing enp0s3 interface
Cluster 3 example :
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
auto enp0s3
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
	address 10.13.42.21
	netmask 255.255.255.252
	gateway 10.13.254.254
	broadcast 10.13.255.255
	dns-nameservers 10.51.1.42
	
	# adress : In the same network as host, and not already taken
	# netmask : /30
	# gateway : `netstat -nr | grep default` (on MAC)
	# broadcast : `ifconfig en0 | grep broadcast` (on MAC)
	# dns-nameservers : `nslookup 42.fr`
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
10.1X.0.0 is the network needed where X is the cluster
dns-nameservers is the same for cluster 1, 2 and 3
`sudo reboot`

:::::::::	
:: SSH ::
:::::::::

Server side :
- `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
- Uncomment 'Port 22' and replace it by 'Port 2222'
- Uncomment 'PermitRootLogin' and replace 'prohibit-password' by 'no'
- Uncomment 'PubkeyAuthentication yes'
- `sudo service sshd restart`

Client side :
- `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@hostIP -p 2222`
- `ssh username@hostIP -p 2222`

::::::::::::::
:: Firewall ::
::::::::::::::

`apt-get install ufw -y`
`sudo ufw allow 2222` #open ssh port
`sudo ufw enable` #activate firewall
`sudo ufw status` #check status
`sudo ufw allow XXXX` #open XXXX port

:::::::::
:: DOS ::
:::::::::

`apt-get install fail2ban -y`

/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
[sshd]

enabled		= true
port		= 2222
logpath		= %(sshd_log)s
backend		= %(sshd_backend)s
maxretry	= 3

`sudo service fail2ban restart`
`sudo fail2ban-client status`

`sudo /etc/init.d/portsentry start`

Test scanning from another machine :
- `nmap -v TARGET_IP`
- `nmap -v -Pn -p 0-2000,60000 TARGET_IP`

Check if said machine was blocked :
- `cat /etc/hosts.deny`

Unblock machine :
- Remove line in /etc/hosts.deny
